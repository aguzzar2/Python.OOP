# # OOP Paradigm Practice in Python
- This repository is dedicated to practicing and demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Python. It includes various Python scripts, each showcasing different aspects of OOP.

- Description bankAccount.py: This file contains the BankAccount parent class, along with two child classes: Checking and Savings. These child classes inherit methods and attributes from the BankAccount class, demonstrating inheritance, one of the core concepts of OOP.
Features
Inheritance: Demonstrated by the relationship between BankAccount, Checking, and Savings classes.
Encapsulation: Showcased through the use of private variables and methods in classes.
Polymorphism: Illustrated via method overriding in child classes.
Abstraction: Simplified interaction with complex bank account operations.
